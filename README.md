<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Hello, my name is Shaikh Rehan Shamimpasha. Today, I am excited to share with you that I have created a Quiz PoP Basic Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As an aspiring web developer, I have been working tirelessly to learn new programming languages and frameworks. With the help of online tutorials and resources, I was able to create a simple yet functional app that allows users to take a quiz and receive immediate feedback on their answers. I am thrilled with the end result and can’t wait to continue improving my skills and creating more exciting projects in the future.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="7">This project is open source, so you can use it as well. All the HTML, CSS, and JS files are available in the “src” folder. To get started, you can clone this repository using the following command:<br>
git clone [<a href="https://github.com/rehanshkh5/Quiz-POP.git">https://github.com/rehanshkh5/Quiz-POP.git</a>]<br>
Once cloned, you will have access to the entire project. Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications or enhancements as needed. Happy coding!<br>
I have used the website <a href="https://surge.sh/">https://surge.sh/</a> to deploy my web app, and I find it very easy to use. I would like to share with you the link to my quiz pop web app: <a href="http://shaikhrehan.surge.sh/">http://shaikhrehan.surge.sh/</a>. Please take a moment to check it out and provide your feedback. The web app is designed to offer a quiz experience, and I am interested to know your thoughts on its functionality and overall design. Your feedback is valuable to me, and any suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to review my web app.</p>
